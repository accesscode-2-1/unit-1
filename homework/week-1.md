If the person you're reviewing hasn't submitted their homework, ask them to submit their homework. If the pull request has too many files, talk to the person you're reviewing and get them to submit a smaller pull request. It is on you to have communication with your reviewee in order to complete this assignment.

Create at least one change based on the code review you receive.

##### Exercise 2: Horoscope app

Create a horoscope app with the following features:
* A [navigation drawer](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html).
* An feature which displays the option to choose one of several different types of "signs". When the sign is
selected, display information about the sign.
* A feature where a user can enter their birthdate and receive information about what their sign is.
* A feature where a user can select two signs and the app will display information about romantic compatibility.
* A game. The game will display a birthdate and will give the user a few seconds'
[countdown](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/CountDownTimer.html) to guess what sign the birthdate
corresponds to. After some number of tries, the game finishes and display the results to the user.
* Different verticial and horizontal layouts throughout the app.

Get creative with your game and look at this [chart on signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac).
