You will be assigned another student for whom to conduct a code review.
Details to follow; we'll discuss this more in class. Create at least one change based on the code review you receive.

##### Exercise 2: Horoscope app

Create a horoscope app with the following features:
* A [navigation drawer](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html).
* An feature which displays the option to choose one of several different types of "signs". When the sign is
selected, display information about the sign.
* A feature where a user can enter their birthdate and receive information about what their sign is.
* A feature where a user can select two signs and the app will display information about romantic compatibility.
* A game. The game will display a birthdate and will give the user a few seconds'
[countdown](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/CountDownTimer.html) to guess what sign the birthdate
corresponds to. After some number of tries, the game finishes and display the results to the user.
* Different verticial and horizontal layouts throughout the app.

Get creative with your game and look at this [chart on signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac).
