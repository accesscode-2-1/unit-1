        There has rarely been a better time than now to refine the art of being your own mommy or
        daddy. You\'re finally ready to take over from the parental voices in your head and assume
        full responsibility for raising yourself the rest of the way. What do you want to be when
        you grow up? You may feel a giddy sense of freedom as it becomes clear that the only
        authority who has the right to answer that question is you.

        Benedictine monks observe the Latin motto Laborare est Orare. The 19th-century abbot Maurus
        Wolter interpreted these words to mean "work is worship" or "work is prayer." He was trying
        to impress upon his fellow monks that the work they did was not a grudging distraction from
        their service to God, but rather at the heart of their devotion. To do their tasks with love
        was a way to express gratitude for having been blessed with the gift of life. I propose that
        you experiment with this approach in the coming weeks, even if your version is more secular.
        What would it be like to feel contentment with and appreciation for the duties you have been
        allotted?

    <string name="horoscope_cancer">
        Here\'s a confession: I have taken a vow to foster beauty, truth, love, justice, equality,
        tolerance, creativity, playfulness, and hope. To do this work is one of my life goals. I
        approach it with the devotion of a monk and the rigor of a warrior. Does that mean I ignore
        difficulty and suffering and cruelty? Of course not. I\'m trying to diminish the power of
        those problems, so I sure as hell better know a lot about them. On the other hand, my main
        focus is on redemption and exaltation. I prefer not to describe in detail the world\'s
        poisons, but rather to provide an antidote for them. Even if you don\'t normally share my
        approach, Cancerian, I invite you to try it for the next two weeks. The astrological time
        is right.

        In 1934, Capricorn baseball player Dizzy Dean was named the Most Valuable Player after
        winning 30 games. It was a feat that no National League pitcher has repeated ever since.
        After Dean retired, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Never shy about acknowledging
        his own prowess, he declared that "if you can do it, it ain\'t bragging." It is in this
        spirit that I invite you to freely expound on your talents and accomplishments in the
        coming week. You won\'t be boasting. You will simply be providing information. And that
        will ultimately result in you being offered an interesting new opportunity or two.

        In the children\'s book The Little Engine That Could, a little blue engine volunteers to
        pull a long chain of train cars up a steep hill, even though it\'s not confident it has
        the power to do so. As it strains to haul the heavy weight, it recites a mantra to give
        itself hope: "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can." The story ends happily. The
        little blue engine reaches the top of the hill with its many cars in tow, and is able to
        glide down the rest of the way. As you deal with your own challenge, Gemini, I recommend
        that you use an even more forceful incantation. Chant this: "I know I can, I know I can,
        I know I can."

        The hill where I take my late afternoon hikes is teeming with the six-petaled purple
        wildflower known as the elegant cluster-lily. Every one of them — and there are hundreds —
        lean hard in the direction of the sun in the west. Should I deride them as conformists that
        follow the law of the pack? Should I ridicule them for their blind devotion? Or should I more
        sensibly regard them as having a healthy instinct to gravitate toward the life-giving light?
        I\'ll go with the latter theory. In that spirit, Leo, I urge you to ignore the opinions of
        others as you turn strongly toward the sources that provide you with essential nourishment.

        According to the three science fiction films collectively known as The Matrix, we humans
        suffer from a fundamental delusion. What we think is real life is actually a sophisticated
        computer simulation. Intelligent machines have created this dream world to keep us in
        suspended animation while they harvest our energy to fuel their civilization. Now as far as
        I can tell, this scenario isn\'t literally true. But it is an apt metaphor for how many of us
        seem to be half-asleep or under a spell, lost in our addiction to the simulated world created
        by technology. I bring this to your attention, Libra, because now is a favorable time to
        diminish the hold that the metaphorical Matrix has on you. What can you do to at least
        partially escape your bondage? (Hint: A little more contact with nature could do the trick.)

        The universe has always played tricks on you. Some have been so perplexing that you\'ve
        barely understood the joke. Others have been amusing but not particularly educational.
        Now I sense a new trend in the works, however. I suspect that the universe\'s pranks are
        becoming more comprehensible. They may have already begun to contain hints of kindness.
        What\'s the meaning of this lovely turn of events? Maybe you have finally discharged a very
        old karmic debt. It\'s also conceivable that your sense of humor has matured so much that
        you\'re able to laugh at some of the crazier plot twists. Here\'s another possibility: You are
        cashing in on the wisdom you were compelled to develop over the years as you dealt with the
        universe\'s tricks.

        Physicist Frank Wilczek won a Nobel Prize for his research into quarks, the tiny particles
        that compose protons and neutrons. The guy is breathtakingly smart. Here\'s one of his
        operating principles: "If you don\'t make mistakes, you\'re not working on hard enough
        problems. And that\'s a big mistake." Let\'s enshrine his advice as your meditation,
        Sagittarius. I think you\'re strong enough and brave enough to go hunting for some new
        super-rich dilemmas. Yes, they may lead you to commit some booboos. But they will also
        stretch your intelligence beyond its previous limits, giving you a more vigorous
        understanding of the way the world works.

        In the coming weeks, you may be as alluring and intriguing and tempting as you have been in
        a long time. I suggest you capitalize on this advantage. Proceed as if you do indeed have
        the power to attract more of the emotional riches you desire. Assume that you are primed to
        learn new secrets about the arts of intimacy, and that these secrets will make you even
        smarter and more soulful than you already are. Cultivate your ability to be the kind of
        trusted ally and imaginative lover who creates successful relationships.

        Here\'s one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health: Withdraw your
        attention from the life that lies behind you, and be excited about the life that stretches
        ahead of you. Forget about the past, and get wildly inventive as you imagine the interesting
        future you will create for yourself. Forgive everyone who has offended you, and fantasize
        about the fun adventures you\'ll go on, the inspiring plans you\'ll carry out, and the
        invigorating lessons you hope to learn.

        Am I reading the astrological omens correctly? I hope so. From what I can tell, you have
        been flying under the radar and over the rainbow. You have been exploiting the loopholes in
        the big bad system and enjoying some rather daring experiments with liberation. At this
        point in the adventure, you may be worried that your lucky streak can\'t continue much
        longer. I\'m here to tell you that it can. It will. It must. I predict that your
        detail-loving intelligence will paradoxically guide you to expand your possibilities even further.

    <!-- profiles -->
    <string name="profile_aquarius">
        Aquarians present themselves in one of two ways. One on hand, you’ll see someone who is shy,
        and quiet. On the other, an Aquarian can be boisterous, eccentric, and energetic. Both are 
        deep thinkers with a love of helping others. Highly intellectual, this is a sign of fierce 
        independence that prizes intuition tempered with logic. Both personality types have an 
        uncanny ability to see both sides of an argument without prejudice, making them excellent 
        problem-solvers. While very much attuned to the energies around them, Aquarians have a deep 
        need to take time out alone and away to rejuvenate themselves. The keyword for this sign is 
        imagination. The Aquarian can see a world of possibilities even when there appears to be none.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_aries">
        As the first sign of the zodiac, the presence of an Aries almost always indicates the 
        beginning of something energetic and boisterous. Not much holds this sign back. They\'re 
        eager, dynamic, quick, and competitive. When it comes to getting the ball rolling, 
        an Aries is the best. Pioneering everything from work-related projects to parties with 
        friends, these folks go for the gusto.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_cancer">
        Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging Zodiac signs to 
        get to know. Emotion runs strong for this sign, and when it comes to family and home, 
        nothing is more important. Sympathetic and empathetic, Cancerians are greatly attuned to 
        those around them. Devotion is the keyword for this sign, making them wonderfully sensitive 
        people to be around.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_capricorn">
        When it comes to professionalism and traditional values, Capricorn wins hands-down. 
        This practical sign loves to tackle life in the most conventional of ways, leaving no stone 
        unturned. Considered the most serious-minded of the signs, the Capricorn possesses an 
        independence that allows for considerable progress both personally and on the job.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_gemini">
        Versatility is a great keyword for this dual sign. Expressive and quick-witted, the Gemini 
        presents two distinctive sides to his or her personality, and you can never be sure with 
        which one you\'re going to come face-to-face. On one hand, the Gemini can be outgoing, 
        flirtatious, communicative, and ready for fun, fun, fun. Yet when the other twin is present, 
        you can find this air sign contemplative, serious, restless, and even indecisive. Both twins
        are able to adapt to life\'s circumstances well, making them wonderful people to know. Things
        are never boring when a Gemini is on the scene.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_leo">
        When the mighty Lion enters center stage, everyone notices. This dramatic, creative, and 
        outgoing sign has the keyword magnetism for good reason. Fiery and self-assured, a Leo\'s 
        charm can be almost impossible to resist. Whether it\'s time spent with family and friends or
        efforts on the job scene, a Leo is going to bring a lot to the table.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_libra">
        "I balance" is the key phrase for this sign, and when it comes to keeping everything on an 
        even keel, a Libran will lead the pack. Peace loving and judicial, this sign abhors being 
        alone. Partnerships are very important for the Libran, especially those on a personal level. 
        With their winning personalities and cooperative style, they aren\'t apt to be alone for long!
    </string>
    <string name="profile_pisces">
        "Understanding" is a most appropriate keyword for this gentle, affectionate sign. Easygoing
        and generally accepting of others around them, Pisceans are often found in the company of a
        variety of different personalities. Their willingness to give of themselves emotionally
        lends to an aura of quiet empathy. A Pisces is comforting to be around. While not likely to
        be the leader, this sign\'s presence is strong and vibrant in any cause they put their hearts into.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_sagittarius">
        Inquisitive and energetic, the Sagittarius is the traveler of the Zodiac. Their 
        philosophical, broad-minded approach to life motivates them to wander far and wide in the 
        search for the meaning of life. Extroverted, optimistic, and enthusiastic, it can be almost 
        impossible to keep the Sagittarius down. They love change. In fact, change is essential for 
        this sign to feel their best.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_scorpio">
        Beneath a controlled, cool exterior beats the heart of the deeply intense Scorpio. 
        Passionate, penetrating, and determined, this sign will probe until they reach the truth. 
        The Scorpio may not speak volumes or show emotions readily, yet rest assured there\'s an 
        enormous amount of activity happening beneath the surface. Excellent leaders, Scorpions are 
        always aware. When it comes to resourcefulness, this sign comes out ahead.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_taurus">
        Strong, dependable Taurus leads the way when it comes to reaping the rewards of hard work. 
        Lovers of everything that is fine and beautiful, Taureans surround themselves with material 
        gains. This is a sensual, tactile sign. Touch is very important in everything from work to 
        romance. Stable and conservative, Taureans are among the most reliable of the zodiac. While 
        sometimes viewed as stubborn, this sign will plod along on a task until the very end, 
        ensuring that everything is up to standard. They\'re highly creative and thoroughly enjoy 
        making things with their own hands.
    </string>
    <string name="profile_virgo">
        With an acute attention to detail, the Virgo is the sign in the zodiac most dedicated to 
        serving. Their deep sense of the humane leads them to caregiving like no other, while their 
        methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is missed. The Virgo is often gentle and 
        delicate, preferring to step back and analyze before moving ahead.
