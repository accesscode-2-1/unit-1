/**
 * Create an Animal class that includes a "species name" field and implements the Comparable interface. Compare two animals by species name, alphabetically.
 Implement equals to compare by species name.
 Test your compareTo function by creating an array of Animal instances and calling sort.
 Create the Domestic interface. This interface should include getters and setters for a name field, since pets tend to have their own names.
 Create a class for a Domestic Animal, perhaps a DomesticCat, that both inherits from Animal and implements the Domesitc interface.
 Implement the compareTo function for your Domestic animal so that it compares two such animals by their given name instead of their species name.
 Implement equals to compare by given name.
 Create a constructor for your Domestic animal that takes in both the species name and given name.
 Test your compareTo function by creating an array and calling sort.
