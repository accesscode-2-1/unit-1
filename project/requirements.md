### Final Project: Scientific Calculator

#### Due Date
A pull request with your code must be issued to the unit-1 `calculator` branch by 18:59 on 5/21 (that is, before class). Presentations will be in class that day.

#### Groups
You will work in assigned [groups of two](groups.md).

#### Description

Create a scientific calculator Android application. For an example, check out [Google Search's Scientific Calculator](https://www.google.com/#q=scientific%20calculator). This application should be both well-designed and functional. Feel free to add additional features beyond the requirements of the application. When submitting your project, include a breakdown of what each group member did (and be prepared to talk about this during the demo) and include a README.md which explains the overall structure of your code.

#### Requirements
* Handle user input and display the results.
* Bind the layout elements in the application.
* Take into account [order of operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) and be generally functional as a calculator. For example, "5 * 3 + 2" is 17, but, "5 * (3 + 2)" is 25.
* Handle configuration changes and activity lifecycle.
* Save and restore instance state (e.g. if calculator is backgrounded).
* Must not crash during demo.
* Have at least two different layouts: a basic calculator when the phone is vertical and a scientific calculator when the phone is horizontal.
