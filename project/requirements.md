### Final Project: Scientific Calculator

#### Due Date
A pull request with your code must be issued to the unit-1 `calculator` branch by 18:59 on 5/21 (that is, before class). Presentations will be in class that day.

#### Groups
You will work in assigned [groups of two](groups.md).

#### Description

Create a scientific calculator Android application. This application should be both well-designed and functional. Feel free to add additional features beyond the requirements of the application. When submitting your project, include a breakdown of what each group member did (and be prepared to talk about this during the demo) and include a README.md which explains the overall structure of your code.

#### Basic Requirements
* Must not crash during demo.
* Handle user input and display the results.
* Bind the layout elements in the application.
* Save and restore instance state (e.g. if calculator is backgrounded).
* Handle configuration changes and activity lifecycle.

#### Feature Requirements
* Have at least two different layouts: a basic calculator when the phone is vertical and a scientific calculator when the phone is horizontal.
* Take into account [order of operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) and be generally functional as a calculator. For example, "5 * 3 + 2" is 17, but, "5 * (3 + 2)" is 25.
* Include all the buttons/operations in [Google Search's Scientific Calculator](https://www.google.com/#q=scientific%20calculator).
* Handle edge cases gracefully. Edge cases include numbers being too large or small to display or to display precisely and division by zero. If you're worried about how to handle these cases, refer to the Google calculator.

#### Bonus Features
* Add graphing calculator functionality.
* Create your own [Style](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html) and apply it to your app.
* Integrate the [Wolfram Alpha API](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/).
* Other calculator-appropriate features!
