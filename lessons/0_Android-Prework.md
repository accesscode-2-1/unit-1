## Prework Assignment

Congratulations on completing the assessment! We hope you enjoyed bootcamp.
In this prework assignment, you'll set up Android Studio and get your first
app up and running.

### Exercise

Watch all of the videos in Bitfountain's [Android Intro Course]
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXWf1CYw-Lq0WyEh7uguXSUnh7SvzSESf).
Follow along with the videos to get Android Studio set up and run your
first Hello World app. An advantage of learning with a video is that you
can increase the speed and rewatch portions that you've already watched.

Here are some resources that might be helpful:
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) - Download Android Studio here.
* [JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) -
this shouldn't be necessary, but in case you don't have JDK 7, you can download it here.
* [Intel HAXM](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager) -
if you follow the videos you should be able to download this through the SDK manager, but if there are any problems you can download it here.
* [Building Your First App](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) -
Different instructions from the official Android documentation.

If you have an Android device, then you can try [running the app on your phone]
(http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html)!
If you don't, don't sweat it - there will be devices in class. See you then!
