    <string name="mainscreentext">Throughout history, many have believed their destiny to depend on the position
        of the stars upon their birth. An idea that is today largely overlooked. One that states that through
        sacred mathematics, by the star\'s very positional nature at the moment of our inception into this world,
        we are to live and reflect a set ancient perspective of the universe on this planet. Each with its
        own attributes to guide the individual on their short journey throughout this world. Take this as you will.
        For every one on earth should have the ability to choose who they are, what to believe in, and the course
        that their journey should take. The contents of this app should serve only as a loose reference guide to that
        and nothing more.</string>
